    "university.introcreate.desc3":"The mod also has a feature called &6Contraptions&r: freeform multiblock machines made out of any block you can think of that do things as they move.",
    "university.introcreate.desc4":"Create really only needs two materials: Copper and Andesite. You should look into starting with the mod once you have a good amount of both.",

    "university.introie.desc1":"&eImmersive Engineering&r adds a lot of large, very pretty multiblock machines.",
    "university.introie.desc2":"However, &6its aesthetic is one of its stronger points&r. Its machines are &cnot very fast&r, and they're quite &cexpensive&r.",
    "university.introie.desc3":"Unfortunately, the mod tends to be &coutpaced by most others&r in any given modpack with it, from a purely mathematical perspective. Arguably this is &6because other mods suffer from powercreep&r, but all the same.",

    "university.intropneum.subtitle":"Air tech",
    "university.intropneum.desc1":"&bPneumaticCraft&r has its own energy system based on pressurized air, which is used to power tools and machines.",
    "university.intropneum.desc2":"Air Pressure is unlike FE in that &chaving too much can damage your machines&r. This makes the mod much more complex than set-and-forget setups from other mods.",
    "university.intropneum.desc3":"It also has other unique mechanics, like &6drones that can be programmed&r using jigsaw-like pieces, as well as upgradable tools and armor.",

    "university.introevilcraft.desc1":"&eEvilCraft&r is a magic/tech mod that has a running theme of &6blood and death&r.",
    "university.introevilcraft.desc2":"Its energy is &6Blood&r, which is generated by killing mobs and can be used to power machines and items.",
    "university.introevilcraft.desc3":"Due to this blood cost, you should generally start the mod &6once you've built up a good animal farm&r.",

    "university.introhex.title":"Hex Casting",
    "university.introhex.subtitle":"Programmatic magic",
    "university.introhex.desc1":"&eHex Casting&r is a magic mod that &6functions more like a programming language&r, where you &6write spells using geometric shapes&r.",
    "university.introhex.desc2":"The only real material cost the mod has is Amethyst; once you have a good amount (and you've got time to learn), you can start whenever.",
    "university.introhex.desc3":"Though cheap to use, the mod is &cvery cerebral&r. It's not just like Ars Nouveau, with its simple modular spells. It's more tailored to people with programming experience than the average player.",

    "university.intromna.title":"Mana and Artifice",
    "university.intromna.subtitle":"Immersive magic",
    "university.intromna.desc1":"&eMana and Artifice&r is the spiritual successor to Ars Magica from the better part of a decade ago.",
